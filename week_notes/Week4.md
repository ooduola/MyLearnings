- [x] Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- [x] Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- [x] Explain the MVC pattern

### Score: 8

#### Reasons for Score
- I enjoyed this weeks challenge involving databases. I'm starting to get a clearer picture of how a web app works on a higher level surface.
- I can clearly understand the basics of how the web works and can clearly explain concepts involving, request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS.
- I can clearly explain the MVC pattern and draw out a model of how they should be intereacting with each other.
- I partially built a web app which was able to store and retrieve data from a relational database and rendering the data back to the client. 
- I can write SQL both in the command line and in a GUI such as Table Plus.
- I can use the CRC model to create objects and tables from a user story.


### Material to re-cover
- Many-to-many relationships
