# Week 2 - Object Oriented Programming
[Back](https://github.com/ooduola/MyLearnings/tree/master/week_notes) | [Week 2 outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md#week-2)

**Week 2 Learning Objectives**
- [x] Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- [x] Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- [x] Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- [ ] Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (Encaptulation, abstraction)
- [x] Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

Achievement plans
- [x] Attend [code review workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/code_review) 
- [x] TDD Exercise with one and two classes
- [ ] Mocking exercise

### Score: 6.5/10

#### Reasons for Score

Week 2 came with its highs and lows. It was really good to have a second week to cover some of the first weeks topics (Debugging, OO principles like SRP and TDD) I found that very useful.
I was happy I completed the dice_game exercise and got some feedback from the coaches. (That reminds me I should start making a feedback.md file on each project and make note of the exact feedback)

I fell short in completing the checkout and mocking exercises. I would have liked to finish this, to further cement my understanding of testing multiple objects. However, I did manage to get some practice with this on the oystercard challenge, which I felt good about.

This week's afternoon challenge(oystercard) felt slightly easier than last weeks (boris-bikes), which I naively took as a sign that I was starting to get better at this coding thing. My pairing feedback was mostly positive, with my partners highlighting my TDD process as a key strength. I was particularly happy with this as I had worked hard to adopt the TDD methodology in it’s purest form. Although I didn’t manage to complete the challenge (this is becoming a recurring theme, I know, shame on me!), I was satisfied with the number of learning outcomes covered in the 14/16 steps, particularly breaking objects into 2 separate classes and testing using mocking/doubles. I will come back and complete these exercises/challenges at some point — it will be a great revision tool for the future.

Then came the weekend challenge (sigh!). I struggled with this! It was a bank holiday weekend meaning we had 1 extra day to complete the challenge and I was excited with the prospect of submitting a polished well thought out program. At first glance, the challenge seemed straight forward, there was a mention of API’s which I was excited about, as up onto this point we hadn’t covered anything to do with API’s, but I was aware of how important they would be in my career as a Software Engineer. (it still feels weird calling myself this, however, dream it, believe it, become it )

I started the challenge with much of Saturday morning dedicated to planning out how I was going to approach the problem — using Domain Modeling Diagrams covered in this week's workshop and once completed I started writing out my program following the trusted TDD process.
Fast forward to Monday afternoon and after finding myself in numerous rabbit holes, I finally realised that my initial assumptions (yes, the not so beautiful diagrams and tables I spent much of Saturday AM working on) were probably wrong and probably the reason why this so-called straight forward challenge was turning into this complicated beast... This was disheartening and definitely a low point for me in week 2. It reminded me of 2 things:
 - Never take anything for granted
 - Continue to adopt a growth mindset

Sometimes, good feedback can give us a false sense of confidence or understanding when in reality we’re probably one assumption away from tumbling back to ground zero on any given challenge. The trick is to find the right balance, this is something I’m going to be working on. Never be too high and never too low. But trust the process and continue to work!

After some reflection (writing this has helped massively), I can honestly say I’ve learned a lot this week and I am a more knowledgable Software Engineer than 7 days ago and for that reason, I will rest well and prepare myself for another week of growing :)

### Material to re-cover
 - OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (abstraction, Forwarding, Polymorphism)
 - Mockings/Doubles
